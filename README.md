# Password Strength Checker

This is a Python project for classifying the strength of passwords using deep learning. It uses a recurrent neural network (LSTM) to analyze passwords and determine whether they are weak, moderate, or strong.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
- TensorFlow (Install using `pip install tensorflow`)
- NumPy (Install using `pip install numpy`)
- pandas (Install using `pip install pandas`)
- scikit-learn (Install using `pip install scikit-learn`)
- Keras (Install using `pip install keras`)

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `main.py`: The main script
- `data.csv`: Your dataset containing passwords and their strength labels.
- `passchecker.py`: A simple Python script to check the strength of a password using the trained model.
